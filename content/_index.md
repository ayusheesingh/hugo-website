I'm a software engineer on the security team 🔐 at Marqeta. I love traveling with family and friends ✈️, reading new genres 📚, daily journaling ✍🏽, Trufusion workout classes 🧘🏾‍♀️, hiking new places 🌲, and photography 📸.

I am passionate about early career communities, women in tech, and mentorship.
